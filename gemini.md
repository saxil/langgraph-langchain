# Gemini CLI Session Log

## Date: 2025-07-11

### User Request:
Generate Markdown files explaining LangChain and its other products, including code snippets.

### Gemini Actions:

1.  **Research:** Performed a Google search for "LangChain and its products" to gather information.
2.  **File Creation:** Generated the following Markdown files in the root directory (`C:\Users\sahil\Desktop\everything\Desktop\Codes\langgraph-langchain\`):
    *   `LangChain.md`: Explains the core concepts of the LangChain framework with Python code examples for Models, Prompts, Chains, Agents, Indexes, and Memory.
    *   `LangGraph.md`: Explains LangGraph for building stateful, agentic applications with code examples for graph creation, state management, and conditional edges.
    *   `LangSmith.md`: Explains the LangSmith platform for debugging, testing, and monitoring LLM applications, with examples for tracing and evaluation.
    *   `Overview.md`: A summary file linking to the other generated documents.
3.  **Self-Correction:** Initially encountered errors due to using relative paths for file operations. Corrected this by retrieving the absolute path of the current working directory (`C:\Users\sahil\Desktop\everything\Desktop\Codes\langgraph-langchain`) and using it for all subsequent file creation operations.
4.  **Context Persistence:** Created this `gemini.md` file to log the session's activities for future reference.
